# README

Quarto.org provides [an introduction](https://quarto.org/docs/dashboards/) to dashboards. You can write them using a `.ipynb` notebook or a `.qmd` file. For this [example](https://github.com/jjallaire/gapminder-dashboard/tree/main) I will be [deploying](https://quarto.org/docs/dashboards/deployment.html) using github pages and a github action.

Note that I configured the repository to publish to GH-pages by running `quarto publish gh-pages` locally ([publish action](https://github.com/quarto-dev/quarto-actions/tree/main/publish)) and included a `_quarto.yml` file to make it a project.

Deployed at: https://krosenfeld-idm.github.io/quarto-python-tutorial/
