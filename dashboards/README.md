# README

Quarto.org provides [an introduction](https://quarto.org/docs/dashboards/) to dashboards. You can write them using a `.ipynb` notebook or a `.qmd` file. For this [example](https://github.com/jjallaire/gapminder-dashboard/tree/main) I will be [deploying](https://quarto.org/docs/dashboards/deployment.html) using github pages and a github action.
